The healthcare sector is undergoing a transformative shift with the advent of Industry 5.0, which focuses on personalizing products and services to meet the unique needs of patients and healthcare providers. 
By integrating technologies like the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI), Industry 5.0 offers a human-centric approach to healthcare,ensuring that solutions are tailored specifically 
to the individual needs of patients.This shift towards mass personalization enhances patient care through applications such as remote consultations, routine health monitoring, disease prediction, critical care 
alerts, and laboratory tests, among others.
However, as healthcare systems become more digitized and interconnected, they also face significant security and privacy challenges. The increased volume of sensitive medical data being shared online makes
it an attractive target for cyber-attacks, including malware injections, unauthorized data disclosures, and denial-of-service(DoS) attacks. These intrusions pose substantial risks, including identity theft, 
insurance fraud, and reputational damage to healthcare providers, undermining patient trust. While machine learning offers potential in detecting cyber threats, existing systems often struggle to adapt to evolving attack patterns,
leading to false positives and negatives. There is an urgent need for effective, adaptive solutions to secure sensitive healthcare data from cyber threats in Industry 5.0-driven systems.
